## Guidelines

These meetings are truly **team gatherings** and are designed to be a **learning environment**. Since, everyone will have different levels of experience using these tools, a primary tenet of these meetings will be **repetition of our processes** so that we can work together effectively and adapt as needed. 

We will model our code review style using [this document](https://github.com/mawrkus/pull-request-review-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#a-practical-guide-for-better-faster-code-reviews). The most important sections are highlighted below.

**We will prioritize:**
  - [**Positive and actionable feedback**](https://github.com/mawrkus/pull-request-review-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#offer-encouragement--appreciation--give-positive-feedback) to each team member
  - [**Empathize and have an open mind**](https://github.com/mawrkus/pull-request-review-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#empathize--the-other-person-is-you)
  - [**Leave comments in your code**](https://github.com/mawrkus/pull-request-review-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#clarify-the-code-first--help-future-developers)
  - [**Add references and examples**](https://github.com/mawrkus/pull-request-review-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#provide-references)


## Overview

### Agendas 

Meeting agendas will be hosted on the [github repository "contributing guidelines" discussions section](https://github.com/Meshinchi-Lab/contributing_guidelines/discussions), which is a website to document our workflows and internal lab procedures.  

If you have any questions or suggestions, please post them discussions section as well! This will be an evolving process as we develop our own bioinformatics team best practices. 

### Meeting Descriptions

There are two Microsoft Teams recurring meeting series for git and github. In general, meetings will always have a virtual component in order to share our screens and easily view each others code.

  1. **"Code Review - paired programming":**
    - *Frequency:* 1x a week on Wednesdays
    - *Description:*
      - focused on gaining experience and familiarity with using `git`, `gh` github CLI commands, and github web features. 
      - review our commits and commit history together
      - push changes to the lab github organization


  2. **"Code Review - formal review":**
    - *Frequency:* 1x every 3 weeks
    - *Description:* 
      - a more in-depth discussion of the technical components of our code
      - ask specific questions and troubleshoot errors
      - get feedback on how to improve the efficiency of our code


## Code Review - paired programming

We'll be holding weekly code review / code commit gatherings to ensure that we're only committing changes that we expect and have not added any files that may not belong on github, such as PDFs or power point presentations, and especially any sensitive data. 

1. Once we all completed the code review / code commit partner checks, then you can push changes to the repository. 

``` bash
git push 
```

2. check that the repository looks the way you expect it to look using the following command:

``` bash
gh repo view --web "${REPO}"
```
