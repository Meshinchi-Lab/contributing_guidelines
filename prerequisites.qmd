## Overview

This page contains README's and internal lab documentation on how to contribute to the Meshinchi Lab and Locatelli lab github organizations. Be sure to have the software requirements installed in order to use this guide.  
:::


## Software

We will be using R, Rstudio, Python, and VSCode

-    [**R and Rstudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed
-   [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed 
-   [**Quarto CLI**](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) installed
-   [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor installed


Alternatively, use **Posit cloud** (formerly Rstudio Cloud). [Posit cloud](https://posit.cloud) is free of charge for personal users, yet you need to [sign up](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) for a new user account and have internet connection.


## Data

The datasets we use can be found here (*insert link*).

## Code

The R and Python scripts, analysis notebooks, and data processing pipelines can be found at the [Meshichi Lab github organization]().

Repositorities have the following nomenclature for easy searching:

  - Data Analysis and Research Projects with collaborators:
  
  - Genomic Data pipelines and workflows:
  
  - R packages: 
  
  - Python packages:
  

## Getting Started

See the [**Getting Started**]() page for complete steps to generating a new analysis or workflow code repository on the github. 
  

## Resources

### Bash and Command Line Tutorial 

A good place to start getting familair with common bash commands is to read the following [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bash/bash_commands.php). Be sure to complete the exercises in the box at the bottom of each page, starting with the `ls` command.

### Quarto and Visual Studio Code Quick Start

The quarto CLI with VS Code editor [quick start](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) is a great tutorial to get familiarized with using quarto (.qmd) documents to generate exploratory analysis notebooks and reports.
